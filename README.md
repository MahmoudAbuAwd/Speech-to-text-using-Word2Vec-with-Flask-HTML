# Speech-to-Text (STT) with Word2Vec and Flask Deployment

## Project Overview
This project implements a Speech-to-Text (STT) system that converts audio input (speech) into text and then applies **Word2Vec** for semantic analysis of the transcribed text. The system is deployed using a **Flask** web application with an **HTML** frontend to enable easy user interaction. Users can upload audio files, convert the speech to text, and analyze the text's semantic meaning using Word2Vec.

## Features
- Convert speech to text using **Google Speech Recognition**.
- Semantic analysis of transcribed text using **Word2Vec**.
- Web-based interface using **Flask** and **HTML** for file upload and result display.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Main programming language.
- **Flask**: Web framework to deploy the application.
- **HTML/CSS**: Frontend for user interaction.
- **speech_recognition**: Python library to convert speech into text.
- **Word2Vec**: Pre-trained model for semantic analysis of text.
- **Gensim**: Library used for Word2Vec model loading and manipulation.
